# ToDoList

This is a demo project, just for fun and your for your confidence in my abilities.

[Demo](https://todolist-78f2e.firebaseapp.com)

## Installation

Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Configuration

To run the app you need:

1) Create a Firebase project, with enabled Database and Google authorization.

2) Create `todos` collection in Firebase Database.

3) Take the Firebase configuration and place it in `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Firebase

You can init you project at this folder and use `firebase deploy` to deploy it to your Firebase hosting.

P.S. Before you will do it you need to build the project :)
